#  NGINX My Garage

## Introduction


In this lab, you will install the My Garage application, configure it for external access, learn to scale the web service, and set up caching for the image gallery (optional).

The My Garage application is a modern web application built using Microsoft .Net technologies. It is comprised of a frontend application and supporting web service backend. The front-end is a Single Page Application (SPA) that uses [Blazor WebAssembly](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) to render the UI in the browser. The back-end is a RESTful API built using [ASP.Net Core MVC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-8.0).
