# NGINXaaS for Azure Workshop

<br/>

## Welcome!

<br/>

> ><strong>Welcome to the NGINX as a Service for Azure Workshop!</strong>

<br/>

This NGINXperts Workshop will introduce **`NGINXaaS for Azure`** with hands-on practice through lab exercises.

You will learn how to configure NGINX for Azure, deploy it with various Azure Resources. 
- You will use many NGINX Plus features, for routing traffic, terminate TLS, splitting traffic, and caching.  
- You will build a sample Enterprise environment with apps and services in Linux and Windows VMs, use Docker, and multiple AKS Kubernetes clusters. 
- You will terminate TLS, route HTTP/S traffic, load balance running VMs, containers, pods and Nginx Ingress Controllers.  
- You will configure Advanced Nginx Plus features like Caching, Dynamic Split Clients for Blue/Green testing, using live traffic.  
- You will expose both Web and TCP applications on the Internet.  
- You will explore the integrations of Nginx with the Azure Cloud Resources like Key Vault, Monitoring, Logging/Analytics, and Grafana.

The Hands-on Lab Exercises are designed to build upon each other, adding additional services and features as you progress through them, completing the labs in sequential order is required.  You will follow along as an instructor guides you through these exercises.
