## NGINXaaS for Azure Workshop

<br/>

### Overview

<br/>

> ><strong>Welcome to the NGINXaaS for Azure Workshop!</strong>

<br/>

This **NGINXperts Workshop** will introduce **`NGINXaaS for Azure`** with hands-on practice through lab exercises.

You will learn and explore NGINX for Azure, deploy and configure it with various Azure Resources. You will use many NGINX Plus features, for routing traffic, terminate TLS, splitting traffic, and caching.  You will build a sample Enterprise environment in Azure with apps and services in Linux and Windows VMs, use Docker, and multiple Kubernetes AKS clusters.  You will terminate TLS, route HTTP/S traffic, load balance running VMs, containers, pods and Nginx Ingress Controllers.  You will configure Advanced Nginx Plus features like Caching and Dynamic Split Clients for Blue/Green testing, using live traffic.  You will expose both Web and TCP applications on the Internet.  You will explore the integrations of Nginx with Azure Cloud Resources like Key Vault, Monitoring, Logging/Analytics, and Grafana.

The Hands-on Lab Exercises are designed to build upon each other, adding additional services and features as you progress through them, completing the labs in sequential order is required.  You will follow along as an instructor guides you through these exercises.

This is the third Workshop in the `NGINXperts Series' from the Nginx Communities and Alliances Team at Nginx.

The Hands-On Lab Exercises are designed to build upon each other, adding additional services and features as you progress through them.  `It is important to complete the lab exercises in sequential order.`

By the end of this Workshop, you will have a working, operational NGINX for Azure deployment and Lab environment, with the skills to deploy and operate one for your Modern Application projects in Azure.
