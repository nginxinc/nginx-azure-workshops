<br/>

This Repo is for learning **`NGINX as a Service in Azure`**, with Instructor Lead and Hands-on Lab Exercises and Lab Guides that will teach a student using real world scenarios for using NGINX in front of Azure Resources.

<br>

**This is an Advanced, 300 Level Workshop.**

## Audience

This Workshop is meant for Cloud and Application Architects, Modern Application Developers, DevOps, Platform Ops, and SRE engineers working with NGINX, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes and Ingress Controllers, to learn and understand how NGINX for Azure works - how it is configured, deployed, monitored and managed.  Using various Azure Resources like VMs, containers, AKS Clusters, and Azure networking, you will deploy real applications for external access using Nginx for Azure.

`The Student taking this Advanced Workshop must have intermediate skills and knowledge with the following:`

- Azure Cloud, Portal and Azure CLI
- NGINX Webserver, Reverse Proxy, Load Balancing
- NGINX Ingress Controller
- Kubernetes Administration
- Redis In Memory Cache and Redis Tools
- TCP, HTTP/S, DNS, Redis protocols and traffic
- Chrome or browser diagnostic tools
- Linux OS commands and tools
- Container / Docker administration
- Visual Studio Code

You should be proficient with the following technologies and concepts.

- Nginx Webserver and Reverse Proxy
- Nginx Ingress Controller
- Kubernetes; nodes, pods, deployments, services, ingress, nodeport
- Azure Cloud; subscriptions, networking, VMs, AKS Clusters
- Various Desktop tools; Visual Studio, Linux, Terminal, Chrome

To meet the Prerequisite skills requirement, there are other Workshops from Nginx and Azure Learning to help you prepare.  The student must have completed the previous two Nginx Workshops, prior to taking this workshop. (Or have equivalent knowledge).  

- Nginx Basics Workshop - 101 (https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-basics-workshops/tree/master/labs)
- Nginx Plus Ingress Workshop - 201 (https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-ingress-workshops/tree/main/Plus/labs)
- Azure Portal and AzureCLI training from Microsoft Learn (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/azure/)

See [Lab0 Readme](/labs/lab0/readme.md) for the Hardware/Software and Skills Prerequisites for taking this Workshop and completing the Lab Exercises.

<br/>

## Getting Started

Review the Github Repo content for the Nginx Basics and Nginx Plus Ingress Workshops.  If you have taken these Workshops, and understand the content, you can successfully complete the Lab exercises in this Nginx for Azure Workshop.  It is HIGHLY recommended that you complete the 101 and 201 Workshops prior.  

It is HIGHLY recommended that you complete Azure Training from http://learn.microsoft.com, so you are familiar with Azure Portal, menus, and various resources and components.

It will take approximately 4 hours to complete the Nginx for Azure Workshop.

<br/>
